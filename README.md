for a lifetime
Bide the Wiccan Law ye must, 
In perfect love, in perfect trust, 
Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill: 
And ye harm none, do what ye will. 
What ye sends forth comes back to thee, 
And ever mind the Rule of Three 
Follow this with mind and heart, 
And merry ye meet and merry ye part.
